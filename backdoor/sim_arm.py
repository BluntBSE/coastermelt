# The jankiest simulator for our janky debugger.
#
# Designed for tracing firmware execution, and untangling code flow while
# talking to actual in-system hardware. The ARM CPU runs (very slowly) in
# simulation in Python, proxying its I/O over a debug port. We need a debug
# port that owns its own main loop, so this doesn't work with the default
# SCSI/USB port, it requires the hardware hack %bitbang interface.
#
# CPU state is implemented as a flat regs[] array, with a few special indices.
# This can be small because it doesn't understand machine code, just assembly
# language. This is really more of an ARM assembly interpreter than a CPU
# simulator, but it'll be close enough.
